# RabbitMQ-with-Python
RabbitMQ is an open-source message-queueing software or message broker where queues are defined, to which applications connect in order to transfer a message or messages.
It is suitable for distributing messages among more than one consumer or load balancing among consumers under high load.It offers both synchronous (when one app directly 
communicates to other app, using HTTP protocol,the app does require immediate response directly from the server) and asynchronous (itâ€™s does not required immediate response from the server, and the message that sent will be placed to a message queue) modes of communication.
